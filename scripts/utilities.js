/* Write a function named forEach in the utilities.js file. For educational purposes, DO NOT use the built-in Array.prototype.forEach function mentioned in the callback resource. The goal is to write your own function named forEach. It should:
Use a loop to go through all elements in the points array.
Execute a callback for each element.
Replace the for loop in the animatePoints function with a forEach block and confirm that the selling points still animate properly. */

function forEach(array, callback){
    for (var i = 0; 1 < array.length; i++)
        callback(array[i]);
